            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Echoes From The Road</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Why this name?</strong> "Echoes" represents the lingering impact of stories and interactions.
                "From The Road" shows how even short conversations or experiences during a trip can leave a lasting memory, even after the ride is
                over.</p>

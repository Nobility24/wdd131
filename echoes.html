            <h2>Every Ride Tells a Story</h2>
            <p>Behind every destination pin lies a journey worth telling. In Echoes from the Road, you enter the world
                of an Uber
                driver, where the city is alive with undiscovered tales, streets become chapters, and strangers become
                characters.
                Between the buzz of the motor and the glow of the streetlights, these real-life moments—which range from
                touching
                encounters to surprising turns—capture the quiet observations, confessions, and laughs that are
                exchanged. The journey
                has just begun, so fasten your seatbelt.</p>

            <p>From 2016 to 2019, I navigated the city streets and encountered countless people whose paths
                momentarily crossed mine. For a while I challenged myself to document one exceptional moment from each
                day spent
                travelling. What started out as a journal evolved into a repository of memories, with unfiltered photos
                and unfiltered thoughts. These entries are more than just rides; they're snapshots of humanity in
                motion.</p>

                    <h3>The Fare That Never Spoke</h3>
                    <p>She stepped in without a word, eyes hidden behind dark glasses. For twenty silent minutes, the
                        city rolled by until one sentence at the drop-off changed everything.</p>

                    <p>He flagged me down in the rain, clutching a garment bag. By the time we reached the venue, I
                        realized I'd
                        just driven a stranger toward the biggest moment of his life.</p>

                    <p>The streets were empty, but his words filled the car. A simple ride turned into a confession that
                        had been
                        bottled up for decades.</p>
